# msutils: Morning Star utilities

Library of tools for writing internal scripts at the Morning Star newspaper.

Included are functions for:

* Fetching edition directories
* Fetching lists of files (PDFs and InDesign) from directories
* Uploading InDesign and PDF pages to FTP and SFTP servers

Most of these work with the `Page` class, which parses a filename of an InDesign or PDF and allows easy renaming to an external name, as well as sorting and so on.
